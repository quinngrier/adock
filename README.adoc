Adock is a Dockerized Asciidoctor wrapper that lets you build and live
preview Asciidoctor documents.

Here's how to get started:

. link:{x_download_url}[Download] the `adock` script.
The script is portable enough to run on any Unix-like system that has
Docker installed.
You can put the script anywhere you like, but the rest of these steps
will assume that you've put it somewhere in your `PATH`.

. Run `echo 'Hello, world!' >foo.adoc` to create a simple Asciidoctor
document, then run `adock foo.adoc` to compile it into `foo.html`.

. Run `adock -s foo.adoc` to do the same thing as the previous step, but
this time also running an HTTP server on `0.0.0.0:8080` to preview the
document.
Open `++http://127.0.0.1:8080++` in a browser and click on `foo.html` to
view the document.
The document will be automatically recompiled and your browser will
automatically refresh as you make changes to `foo.adoc`.
When you're done, press kbd:[Ctrl+C] to stop and remove the Docker
container.

. Run `adock -ds foo.adoc` to do the same thing as the previous step,
but this time running the Docker container in the background instead of
the foreground.
When you're done, run `docker rm -f adock` to stop and remove the Docker
container.

. Run `adock -u` to pull the latest version of the Docker image and
download and replace `adock` itself with the latest version of `adock`.

. For more advanced usage, see the link:{x_man_page_url}[man page].

== Asciidoctor PDF support

Adock includes an {x_Asciidoctor_PDF} theme file `/adock-theme.yml` that
can be used to add {x_KaTeX} fonts to the font catalog.
The fonts are named `KaTeX_Main` and `KaTeX_Typewriter`.
The fonts also have some extra glyphs added to them.
Here's an example of how to use this in your own theme file:

----
extends:
  - /adock-theme.yml

base:
  font-family: KaTeX_Main

code:
  font-family: KaTeX_Typewriter

codespan:
  font-family: KaTeX_Typewriter
----

== Math support

* {x_Asciidoctor_Mathematical} is
link:src/asciidoctor-mathematical.patch[patched] to improve the size of
math expressions.

* {x_Lasem}, which is a dependency of {x_Asciidoctor_Mathematical}, is
link:src/lasem.patch[patched] with the following changes:

** {x_KaTeX} fonts are used instead of generic fonts.

** A bug that was preventing `\mathtt` from working is fixed.

// TODO: Add an example document that displays a bunch of math?
//       adock -r asciidoctor-pdf -r asciidoctor-mathematical -a stem=latexmath example.adoc

== Diagram support

{x_Asciidoctor_Diagram} can be enabled using the `{x_asciidoctor_r}`
option of `{x_asciidoctor}` with `asciidoctor-diagram` as the argument.
For example:
`adock {x_asciidoctor_r} asciidoctor-diagram foo.adoc`.

The following diagram types are supported:

* link:https://www.bpmn.org/[BPMN,window=_blank]
(link:https://quinngrier.github.io/adock/examples/bpmn/[example,window=_blank])

* link:https://graphviz.org/[Graphviz,window=_blank]
(link:https://quinngrier.github.io/adock/examples/graphviz/[example,window=_blank])

* link:https://pikchr.org/[Pikchr,window=_blank]
(link:https://quinngrier.github.io/adock/examples/pikchr/[example,window=_blank])

** Pikchr is link:src/pikchr.patch[patched] to allow `\<` and `\>`
escapes to be used in strings, which emit `<` and `>` directly into the
SVG code instead of `&amp;gt;` and `&amp;lt;`.
This allows SVG tags such as `<{x_tspan}>` to be used.
For example:
`box "\<{x_tspan} {x_style}=\"{x_fill}: {x_red}\"\>foo\</{x_tspan}\>"`.
